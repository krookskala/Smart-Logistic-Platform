# Smart Logistics Platform

The Smart Logistics Platform is a modern, production grade web application that reimagines how logistics operations are managed from end to end. Designed around a role based architecture, it delivers three distinct experiences an **Admin Panel** for operational oversight and courier dispatch, a **User Dashboard** for shipment creation and package tracking, and a **Courier Workspace** for managing assigned deliveries in the field. Every status change is broadcast instantly through real time WebSocket channels, giving all stakeholders immediate visibility into the delivery pipeline. Built with Next.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL and Socket.IO, the platform combines enterprise level security practices JWT authentication with token rotation, ownership enforced access control and comprehensive audit logging with a clean, responsive interface that works seamlessly across devices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20 or higher
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (for PostgreSQL)
- **npm** (included with Node.js)

### Quick Start (Recommended)

A single command starts PostgreSQL, the backend, and the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This launches:
- **PostgreSQL** on port `5432` (via Docker)
- **Backend** on port `3001` (NestJS with hot-reload)
- **Frontend** on port `3000` (Next.js dev server)

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop. Then clean up:

```bash
npm run dev:stop
```

### Docker Compose (Full Stack)

Run everything in containers (no hot-reload):

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Manual Setup

1. **Start PostgreSQL**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

2. **Backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm run prisma:migrate
   npm run prisma:seed       # optional: load demo data
   npm run start:dev
   ```

3. **Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://logistics:logistics@localhost:5432/logistics
JWT_SECRET=
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
JWT_ISSUER=
JWT_AUDIENCE=
PORT=3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## Security & Access Control

The backend enforces role aware and ownership aware access at every layer:

- **ADMIN:** Full access to all shipments, users, couriers, and audit logs
- **USER:** Can only access shipments they created
- **COURIER:** Can only access shipments assigned to their courier record
- **Tracking events:** Restricted to the assigned courier or admins

The UI is role specific, but the **real security boundary is enforced in the backend**. Even if the frontend were bypassed, unauthorized API calls would be rejected.

Additional protections:
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints (5 requests/minute)
- Global rate limiting (60 requests/minute)
- Request payload validation with unknown field rejection
- UUID format validation on all route parameters
- Bcrypt password hashing with configurable salt rounds
- Refresh token rotation with SHA-256 hashing

---

## Real Time Tracking

Shipment tracking uses Socket.IO for instant status updates:

1. **Connection:** Client connects with JWT token for authentication
2. **Room join:** Client joins `shipment:<id>` room (authorized access only)
3. **Event broadcast:** When a courier updates tracking, the event is emitted to the room
4. **Live update:** All clients viewing that shipment receive the update instantly

This architecture ensures each tracking page only receives events for the relevant shipment, with no unnecessary data transfer.

cd frontend && npm run test
```

### Quality Checks

```bash
npm run format:check    # Prettier formatting

## Demo Flow

A suggested walkthrough for showcasing the platform:

1. **Start the stack**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

2. **Seed demo data**
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm run prisma:seed
   ```

3. **Admin:** Log in as `admin@example.com` / `Admin12345!`
   - View metrics dashboard and shipment overview
   - Promote `user1@example.com` to `COURIER` via role management
   - Assign the new courier to `Demo Shipment 2`

4. **Courier:** Log in as `courier@example.com` / `Courier12345!`
   - View assigned deliveries
   - Update tracking status with a delivery note

5. **Real Time:** Open a shipment tracking page
   - Watch live updates appear as the courier posts tracking events

6. **User:** Log in as `user2@example.com` / `User12345!`
   - Verify they can only see their own shipments
   - Create a new shipment and track it
